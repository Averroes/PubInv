# Public Invention for All Humanity

## A Personal Invitation

The creation of new technology is not the only or best way to help our fellow-beings. Love is more important than lasers, and kindness more important than computers. Still, many of us are better suited to serve humanity in code than in a sermon, or holding a test tube rather than the hand of the dying.

If you are one of those persons, I invite you to participate with me in a project I call Public Invention For All Humanity (PIFAH). Throughout 2015, we hope to run a number of projects best described as “inventions” that will be valuable to humanity. This is not particularly original. This is yet another project in the exponentially growing tradition of working for the public good.

What we do hope to use some modern principles:
* We will be completely transparent and open from the first.
* Everything we produce will be shared to everyone without exception.
* We will organize our using an Agile methodology, whether our work is software, hardware, research, or education.
In other words, this will be an free-libre open-source project that welcomes participation from the public and seeks to organize work so that the work so that as many hands can pitch in as possible, and so that as many voices can contribute as possible.

I am not committed to this project. If I find an existing project that can utilize my talents better, I may drop PIFAH to assist others. I don’t want this to be about me.

But of course that is inevitable, at least at the beginning. There is no point in false humility. I really want to act as the head coach of PIFAH, and I think I can do it well.

I have an adequate technological resume, particularly as a computer programmer. More importantly, however, I enjoy leading teams and am good at it. I mentor people well. Finally, I am able and willing to devote myself full-time to this project, at least for a while.

You may wish to examine our project [concepts](https://github.com/PIFAH/PIFAH/tree/master/ideas) to see if any appeal to you.

# Warning

Some of the projects proposed here involve dangerous chemicals, powerful forces, fire, explosive gases, and biological hazards.
Humanity an not advance without experiementation that involves some risk. The important thing is to remain safe 
at all times and not to proceed with an experiment until you have proper safety eqipment and training. In particular,
although we encourage young people to participate in PIFAH, they should not participate without adult supervision.

We will attempt to discuss safety precautions within each project.  However, because this is a distributed project 
and each participant may be creating their own experiments and machiens, it will not be possible for us to 
provide safety guidance in all cases.  Please proceed carefully at your own risk.
