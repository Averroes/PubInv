# A Personal Invitation

The creation of new technology is not the only or best way to help our fellow-beings. Love is more important than lasers, and kindness more important than computers. Still, many of us are better suited to serve humanity in code than in a sermon, or holding a test tube rather than the hand of the dying.

If you are one of those persons, I invite you to participate with me in a project I call Public Invention (PubInv). Throughout 2015, and now 2016, we hope to run a number of projects best described as “inventions” that will be valuable to humanity. This is not particularly original. This is yet another project in the exponentially growing tradition of working for the public good.

What we do hope to use some modern principles:
* We will be completely transparent and open from the first.
* Everything we produce will be shared to everyone without exception.
* We will organize our work using an Agile methodology, whether our work is software, hardware, research, or education.
In other words, this will be an free-libre open-source project that welcomes participation from the public and seeks to organize work so that the work so that as many hands can pitch in as possible, and so that as many voices can contribute as possible.

I am not committed to this project. If I find an existing project that can utilize my talents better, I may drop PubInv to assist others. I don’t want this to be about me.

But of course that is inevitable, at least at the beginning. There is no point in false humility. I really want to act as the head coach of PubInv, and I think I can do it well.

I have an adequate technological resume, particularly as a computer programmer. More importantly, however, I enjoy leading teams and am good at it. I mentor people well. Finally, I am able and willing to devote myself full-time to this project, at least for a while.

You may wish to examine our project [concepts](https://github.com/PubInv/PubInv/tree/master/ideas) to see if any appeal to you.

# Accomplishments So Far

* [The Gluss Project](https://github.com/PubInv/gluss/) has demonstrated a very novel unconventional robot. 
* The [Gluss Pusher project](https://github.com/PubInv/Gluss-Pusher/tree/master) is developing an inexpensive prototype linear actuator for building large, highly scalable robots.
* We have published a legitimiate novel invention: [The Turret Joint](https://github.com/PubInv/turret-joint) which is essential to the construciton of Gluss robots.
* The [Gluss Pusher project](https://github.com/PubInv/Gluss-Pusher/tree/master) has created an inexpensive Arduino based way of measuring absolute position of the pushrod using just an LED and a photocell.
* We've created and published [CoilChoice](http://pifah.github.io/CoilChoice/), and interactive tool for desiging electromagnetic coils.
* This project later took 4th place on the Women in Technology Institute (WITI) Virtual Hackathon.
* A team formed at the Austin Hack for Change Civic Hackathon won "Most Hacked Forward" superlative with [ATX Preemie Warmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb-F0qTptJs&list=PL9nAioXQFlE59Aalkz2NbcodxL4__Su7y).

# How to Contribute

For specific immediate needs, please see [HELP_WANTED.md](https://github.com/PubInv/PubInv/blob/master/HELP_WANTED.md) file.

We welcome your participation.  You are welcome to email me <read.robert@gmail.com>.  However, as a public project, it is even better for you to comment publicly.  You can do this by opening an "issue" here at GitHub.  If you want to add to or improve one of the existing documents, you can do this with a "pull request".

In general, each project will have a set of "stories".  This is a technique developed by the Agile community. We welcome you to take on the execution of a story if that fits your talents.  Writing new stories is also very important activity.

I hope that we will have need for many talents. I am a computer scientist. I greatly admire artists but don't pretend that I can create art. We will always have a need for artists, writers, and educators.

We will also need chemists, welders, mechanical engineers, 3D modellers, software engineers, physicists, biologists, mycologists---we exclude no field of endeavor.

In summary, you can contribute by:

* Suggesting a new project,
* Working on a story,
* Offering to improve our art or wrting,
* Offering to lead a project,
* Teaching us something new, or
* Even suggesting non-PubInv proejcts that we should contribute to.

If you are not familiar with GitHub or git, please email me to give you assistance.

# A Warning

Some of the projects proposed here involve dangerous chemicals, powerful forces, fire, explosive gases, and biological hazards.

Humanity an not advance without experiementation that involves some risk. The important thing is to remain safe 
at all times and not to proceed with an experiment until you have proper safety equipment and training. In particular,
although we encourage young people to participate in Public Invention, they should not participate without adult supervision.

We will attempt to discuss safety precautions within each project.  However, because this is a distributed project 
and each participant may be creating their own experiments and machines, it will not be possible for us to 
provide safety guidance in all cases.  Please proceed carefully at your own risk.
