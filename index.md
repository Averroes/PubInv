The Mission of Public Invention is to invent things that help humanity.

We follow these principles:

* **Share everything equally and immediately.** Do not seek patents that imply a monopoly that is the antithesis of sharing.
* **Work in the light.** In addition to publishing successful inventions, publish failures. Publish mediocrity. Publish everything. Work in the public for the public.
* **Keep it real.** Always be working towards a real invention that reallys helps people.
It is better to make something tiny and real than to make something grand and awesome
that is not real. A roller skate is better than a toy space fighter.
* **Don't build weapons.** Technology is not neutral. Some things are more easily
used for good and harder to pervert than others. Invent things that heal, help,
educate, entertain, enlighten, strengthen, and ennoble humanity.
* **Seek egalitarian usefulness.** All else being equal, inventions which make us more
equal are better than inventions that make us less equal.
* **Collaborate whenever possible.** Even if it slows you down, try to involve others
whenever you can.
* **Honor and value every contribution.** Some inventions require specialized math;
all inventions require general communications and the most specialized and the
most general skills are all needed.



# Who we are in 2018

Robert L. Read is the head coach and founder of Public Invention, and devotes
most of his time to it. Other participants include Joshua L. Hannon, Evan Bartilson,
Morgan Chen, Keeshan Patel,
and Neil Martis. We plan to incorporate in 2019, and are actively seeking
additional volunteers, and, above all, public inventors.

# Accomplishments So Far

* We have produced [26 open-source](https://github.com/PubInv) repos of work so far.
* Our biggest accomplishment has been revitalizing the [Tetrobot concept](https://pubinv.github.io/tetrobot/).
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYpHKjkcXKA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
* Published peer-reviewed academic journal article describing simple optimization of a [tetrahelix](http://mechanismsrobotics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2683455).
* [The Gluss Project](http://pubinv.github.io/tetrobot/) has [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8XSMhwKUE) a very novel unconventional robot.

* Developed a [3D printable optical linear sensor](https://github.com/PubInv/optical-linear-sensor/blob/master/doc/OpticalDisplacementSensor.pdf) (with Keeshan Patel.)
* Published an [article](http://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/setting-up-the-raspberry-pi-3) on using the Raspberry Pi in Nuts and Volts (with Morgan Chen.)
* The [Gluss Pusher project](https://github.com/PubInv/Gluss-Pusher/tree/master) is developing an inexpensive prototype linear actuator for building large, highly scalable robots.
* We have published 3D plans for a legitimiate novel invention: [The Turret Joint](https://github.com/PubInv/turret-joint) which is essential to the construciton of Gluss robots (this was invented by Song, Kwon, and Kim.)
* We've created and published [CoilChoice](http://pifah.github.io/CoilChoice/), and interactive tool for desiging electromagnetic coils.
* This project later took 4th place on the Women in Technology Institute (WITI) Virtual Hackathon.
* A team formed at the Austin Hack for Change Civic Hackathon won "Most Hacked Forward" superlative with [ATX Preemie Warmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb-F0qTptJs&list=PL9nAioXQFlE59Aalkz2NbcodxL4__Su7y).
* An educational [double pendulum simulation](https://pubinv.github.io/chaos-pendulum/) has been created,
as part of an unsolicited proposal to Montshire Science Museum for a physical exhibit.
If any knows of a better double-pendulum simulation, please let me know.

# How to Contribute

We welcome your participation.  You are welcome to email me <read.robert@gmail.com>.
However, as a public project, it is even better for you to comment publicly.
You can do this by opening an ("issue")[https://github.com/PubInv/PubInv/issues] here at GitHub.  If you want to add to or improve one of the existing documents, you can do this with a "pull request".

You may wish to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T8XSMhwKUE">YouTube Channel</a>. Since we are bound neither by the need to keep something secret due to patent restrictions imposed by Universities, nor by the formality of Academic publishing, nor by the need to maintain trade secrets, we publish informally a lot at YouTube.


At the momement, we have a **desperate need for someone who can sketch** (like with a pencil) to do some simple art for our most active project, [The Gluss Project](http://pubinv.github.io/tetrobot/).

I am a computer scientist. I greatly admire artists but don't pretend that I can create art. We will always have a need for artists, writers, and educators.

We will also need chemists, welders, mechanical engineers, 3D modellers, software engineers, physicists, biologists, mycologists---we exclude no field of endeavor.

In summary, you can contribute by:

* Offering to improve our art or wrting or videos,
* Suggesting a new project,
* Working on a story,
* Offering to lead a project,
* Teaching us something new, or
* Even suggesting non-PubInv proejcts that we should contribute to.

If you are not familiar with GitHub or git, please email me to give you assistance.

# A Warning

Some of the projects proposed here involve dangerous chemicals, powerful forces, fire, explosive gases, and biological hazards.

Humanity an not advance without experiementation that involves some risk. The important thing is to remain safe 
at all times and not to proceed with an experiment until you have proper safety equipment and training. In particular,
although we encourage young people to participate in Public Invention, they should not participate without adult supervision.

We will attempt to discuss safety precautions within each project.  However, because this is a distributed project 
and each participant may be creating their own experiments and machines, it will not be possible for us to 
provide safety guidance in all cases.  Please proceed carefully at your own risk.
