RF, or dielectric heating, is used to dry wood in some circumstances.

I wonder if we could build a simple circuit to do this on a very small scale, like for a leaf?

I bet Jeri Ellsworth could do this!

I vaguely remember that use can make a simple RC circuit to oscillate at whatever freqency you want.  I would of
course do this in shielded environment.
