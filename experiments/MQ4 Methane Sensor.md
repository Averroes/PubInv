# Experimenting with MQ4 Methan Sensor

I'm doing some work with Engineers Without Borders (Greater Austin Chapter) and we are trying to build a methane
sensor to drive a fan in a latrine.

I got the sensor today and there are some problems:
* It comes with no documentation.
* The letters MQ4 are engraved on the band, but so faintly as to be illegible.
* It has reflection symmerty, so I can't figure out which is pin 1 and which is pin 4, so I don't know how to wire it.

It has what looks like a good data sheet: https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Biometric/MQ-4%20Ver1.3%20-%20Manual.pdf
apart from the above problems.

The sensor doesn't plug into a standard Sparkfun breadboard.  Their is a breaout board for sale, but it is back ordered.

I am pretty ignorant when it comes to electronics, so I don't really know how to mechanically connect this.  I suppose 
I could solder six wires to the 6 pins but that seems like a bad idea---but I have to do something.

Luckily, the Arduino people give much better instructions:

After considerable effort, I'm giving this up for now.  I tried to bend the leads to fit into bread board.  I suppose if I had six very small aligator clips I might be able to do this.

I'm putting this down for now.
