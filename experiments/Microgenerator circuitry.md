This is a very simple exercise: Build a circuit that take energy from "shaking" a magnet inside a coil and use it to
charge a capacitor. Perhaps use the arduino to measure and display the charge on the capacitor.

This refeence shows a beautiful circuit called a "Villard Charge Pump", which seems quite relevant, a voltage multiplier.
