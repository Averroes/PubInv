Pyrolysis of wood tends to retain the structure of the wood perfectly.  However, wood is woody.  What if we try 
to pyrolyze or char:
* A carrot?
* A leaf?
* A beetle?
* A human stool sample?

Do we get an artifact that is preserved and stable and worthy of study?  Can you tell that a live oak leaf is a live oak leaf?
Can you look at things under a microscope and observe anything valuable from them?
