How to the byproducts produced and the total time to reduce to complete biochar change if you perform the charring in a
vacuum?

One supposes that in some way the removal of gases will proceed more rapidly in a vacuum, but one still must pay the
energy cost of separation.  It would be nice to peform a controlled experiment, charring the same material at the same 
temperature for the same amount of time, one at 1 bar and one at a vacuum.  One could then compare the amount of charring,
including the mass of the residual material, and the mass of the residual carbon (which is harder to measure, but could 
be done by a separate step driving to complete charring.
