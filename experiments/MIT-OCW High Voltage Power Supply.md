Today I built, after about 20 hours of labor, confusion, and mistakes, a working High Voltage Power Supply that supplies 
1000V or more with input power of 4 volts.

This is part of the MIT Open Courseware Physics and Electricity course : http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-02x-physics-ii-electricity-magnetism-with-an-experimental-focus-spring-2005/labs/building_hvps.pdf

The claim is that this power supply is relatively safe despite the high voltage because it produces a very low amperage (in theory
less than a milliamp.) I am unsure of that, because I may have mistakenly chosen components that are different.

I built this both as a learning exercise, but more importantly as a step to being able to do the Radio-Frequency heating 
experiments mentioned elsewhere in this directory.

Note: My friend David Vaughan who assisted me with this also built one.  He tried to drive it up to 1 Megahertz in oscillation (the circuit as designed oscillates at about 215KHz.) Unfortunately as he did so the output voltage dropped precipitously. Sadly I am not a good enough electical engineer to immediatly understand why this out to be the case.
