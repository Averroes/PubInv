# STATUS: PERFORMED

I wrapped a piece of dried mesquite wood in foil.  I suspect it weighed about 100 grams.

I broiled in for an hour in toaster oven.  After this it was partially charred.  Made the house smell like mequite,
though I noticed not visible smoke.

At this point it was NOT good biochar.  It was still partially brown, still partially "tough" and hard to break 
with my fingers.

# RESULTS

The next day I put under my gas broiler for 30 minutes.  I suspect this was much hotter and much closer to the heat 
source.  The result was complete charring as described on various YouTub Videos.  It sounded like glass when you
dropped it on a plate and it was very brittle and easy to break.  It was extremely black through-and-through.
