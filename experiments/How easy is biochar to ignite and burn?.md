# STATUS: PERFORMED

Tomorrow, I will try to ignite my biochar with a match.  I assume it will ignite very easily because if its porous nature.

I assume further more that it will burn smokelessly.  We'll see.

# RESULTS

I performed this experiment.  Biochar lights with a match but does not produce a flame.  I produces an ember.  In "still" air the edges glow and slowly burn.  If you blow on it or force more air into it (with a chimney, for example) it will glow brighter and burn faster.

It appears to produce no smoke at all.
