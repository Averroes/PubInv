The basic question is: Could we use leaves in closer to their natural form to make paper, or paper-like products?

An alternative questions is: Could we use naturally occuring pine straw as a fiber to strengthen packing materials?

Experiment:

I picked up some brown and dry live oak leaves and loquat leaves.  The loquat leaves are the big once.  If left them 48 hours
in a solution of about 30% household bleach.  As you can see they partially bleached.

On the live oak leaves, I was able to write my name and some numbers with a ball-point pen.

The leaves are very brittle compared to paper.
