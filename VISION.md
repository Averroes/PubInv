# Vision Statement

Public Invention For All Humanity works directly for the benefit of all persons by creating and publishing life-enriching technology and technological experience into the shared creative commons.

We seek a human society which is:
* sharing,
* peaceful,
* abundant,
* egalitarian,
* enriches the Earth,
* affirms and uplifts all life,
* expanding in space and time, and
* restoring, reclaiming and conserving the past.

We believe the universe is infinite in all directions, and that humanity has a purpose in that Universe. We are guiding by a vision of humanity exploring the stars together in peace. 

We do not:
* promote monopolies,
* divert our energy into trivia,
* build weapons,
* horde knowledge,
* have a credal test, or
* practice favoritism.
