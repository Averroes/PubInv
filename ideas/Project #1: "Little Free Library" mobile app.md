The [Little Free Library](http://littlefreelibrary.org) movement is a beautiful way to share books.  (I have one in my front yard.)   

At the above website they have a map and registration process.

However, I think we could do far better.  We could create a mobile phone app allows you not only to publish the location of the library.

Furthermore, we can imagine an app that lets you take a photograph of the library.  This could be added to a database to allow
books to be searched. If we had such a photo, we might be able to use optical character recognition to create not just 
a library datbase, but an actual book database.

An additional idea would be to allow the ISBN bar code to be read and interpreted.

We can imagine making an app that allows you to record when the book is removed as well, in order to keep the book database
highly up to date.

One of the advantages of this project is that it is relatively easy.  I have never written a cell-phone app but I suspect
I could get most of this working week.  Making it production ready might take more time.
