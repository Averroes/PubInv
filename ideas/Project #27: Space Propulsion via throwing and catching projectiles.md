# Space Propulsion Via Throwing and Catching Projectiles

## Contact in Time

The problem of providing propulsion to significant fractions of the speed of light or moving paylods away from the gravity well
of Earth has been extensively considered.  This is yet another idea.

Imagine a machine, like a gauss rifle, which can throw a projectile, and also catch a projectile.  If two such machines face 
each other and begin throwing and catching projectiles, they will move further apart at increasing velocity, never changing
momentum of centroid of the system.

As the two machines get further away, it takes longer and longer for the projectile to travel between the machines.
Suppose, howewver, that you had many machines, which could each be distributed along the path of the projectile, and
each of which could exchange momentum with the projectile(s), in either direction.

We could then imagine that over time, say in the journey to Pluto, the machines spread out along the line, but that 
the distance between any two machines is somewhat limited.

One can imagine that in principle this might provide an efficient way to propel the furthest machine.

A number of mathematical questions arise:

* If power is free at one machine and the machine at the other extreme can catch and rethrow the projectile back perfectly,
can we propel the hole system from just the one machine?
* If we can provide power at each machine, what performance can we hope to achieve?
* What is the optimum distribution of machines along the track?
* Thinking from engineering rather than mathematics and physics, what sort of catch-velocity can we really hope to achieve?
* Is there some way to imagine projectiles passing each other so that we can add any number of projectiles to the system?

Conceptually, we are making a single spacecraft which "telescopes" itself out to an extreme length, but we have taken this 
concept so far that the parts of the machine are not actually in physical contact with each other, though in a sense
they are in "contact in time".  From a physicists point of view, they are a single system of particles.
