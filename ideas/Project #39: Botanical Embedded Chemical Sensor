This idea is completely unresearched; it may be old-hat for all I know.

I think it would be really power to be able to embed a sensor in a plant that could measure chemicals, especially sugar levels,
but possibly phytohormones as well.

The ability to quickly sense chemical changes inside a plant would open up a wide variety of experiments in botany.

This is something that a hobbyist-level microelectronics person can probably do. There is now off-the-shelf sensor technology
that should do this, though I have no doubt that once begun we will say "If only we had an XXX sensor...."
