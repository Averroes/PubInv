Build a “blanket” that can be placed over a fallen log to make biochar in place.

The basic idea is to make something that can be transported easily and could char a log or brush pile in place without needing to transport the log out, which is very costly.

This would allow someone to have a brushpile turned into biochar safely.

One way to think about this would be to build a geodesic dome.  Essentially it we would be building a portable retort.   This would allow us to char quickly in place.

On youtube “Biochar workshop” you can see a lot of advantage of his.  This is a carbon sequestration idea.  

This could be done on a very small scale safely.

We could construct this out of iron, and fold it up like a geodesic dome.  As shown, we need to control oxygen flow to turn this into a retort.  It has to have a chimney.  It has to a

Note that one of the wonderful things about this is our ability to this in a very small scale.

## Basic storification:

* Build the device with manual controls.  Test that it works.
* Add instrumentation.
* Add an Arduino control.
* Scale up.
* Experiment: Can we wrap a piece of wood in aluminum foil to protect it from oxygen and make biochar that way? (Apparently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOdk-JclCBI) but I would like to perform this experiment myself. 
* Is 500 F (a mere 260 C) enough for making biochar?
* Can we build a heat pipe to jam into the center of the brush pile to provide more even heating? (Seems unlikely and dangerous.)


## Experiments

### Charring in foil

I charred a piece of mesquite wood, probably about 15 grams, covered in aluminum foil in my toaster oven.  After an hour at 450 F, it was barely charred.  After 30 minutes on the "broil" setting, which has no temperature setting but is probably the maximum power for this oven, it was significantly but not perfectly charred.  Breaking open the piece it was blackened through and through, but it was not the "glasslike" biochar described on YouTube.  I would claim this was about 50% properly charred.  A longer experiment may be possible, but I would rather have a temperature control.
