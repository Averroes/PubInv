# Motivation

[Dr. Denis Parons Burkitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Parsons_Burkitt) is famous for discovering Burkitt's
lymphoma and for discovering and emphasizing the importance of dietary fiber for human health.  In particular his 
research led to the observation that many diseases afflicting affluent nations are diseases of excess.

The quality of diet is relatively easy to observe in the stool.  High-fiber diets produce volumninous stools which
are less dense and hard than those of low-fiber diets.

Both for the health of the affluent and to observe other affects in the less affluent, I believe we could build
an instrumented toilet which provides valuable data analysis.

# Ideas

We can imagine a toilet that tracked and recorded:
* Every bowel movement and associated each with a user,
* Analyzed density,
* Analyzed volume,
* Analyzed pH,
* Visually inspected for macroscopic parasites (helminths and worms),
* Analyzed color,
* Looked for blood streaks.

Melody Kramer added the valuable insight that:
"With urine, could conduct:

pregnancy tests
STD tests
UTI tests
BAC Test (imagine a toilet in a nightclub telling you if you couldn't drive)",

to which I think we might be able to add a test for diabetes.  In fact this is a wonderful idea, and probably easier than my original idea!  Thanks, Mel!

Note that in "West", parasites are generally not a problem, whereas getting enough fiber is. The situation
is reversed in less affluent nations, where plant-based diets are more common, but parasites are more
of a problem in those nations (which are correlated with tropical climate.) This idea could be valuable
in hospitals, even if it is impractical for everyday use, although no doubt by the time humanity 
is ready to explore the stars in space together every toilet will work this way.
