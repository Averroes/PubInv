# Develop a new way of thinking about the expansion of e. (and sin, and cos)

This is a an admittedly half-baked idea.  My knowledge of analysis is woefully incomplete, something I am attempting to remedy.

Nonetheless, as a "public inventor", I work in the light, even the light shows how silly I am.
 
Consider the Taylor series expansion of [sin x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series):

Sigma (x = 0 -> infinity)  -1^n * x^(2n+1)/(2n+1)!

Now speaking only for myself this is deeply weird to think that no matter what x we put in, this summation stays in the
interval [-1,1].  To a mathematician, this might not be weird, but think about this as a computer scientist.
We know it sort of make sense that x from 0 to 2 * pi is going to beheave somewhat reasonably.

But consider if we put in x of "100". The first terms in this expansion are GIGANTIC. In fact if you plot them
they rise and rise up to a maximum.  The values are alternately negative, which is what keeps the result from being 
huge.  If we look at the "envelope" of both the positive and negative values it will have a pronounced bulge 
which increase as x increases. The values get huge, yet always seem to cancel out.

I'm told the proof that this expansion is periodic is tricky, and I believe it --- it seems crazy that it can be.

Now thinking as a computer programmer rather than a mathematician, doesn't this mean that we are representing 
our series incorrectly?  Doesn't it make sense to recast the series in terms of where the maximum value is?

If we were calculating this by hand, we would not start at the 0 term---we would start at the maximum value,
and then adjust moving to the left and right of this value.

Basically, the fact that x^n/n! grows with x up to a point and then diminishes suggests that they're may 
be some valuable way of looking at the summation differently.  (I know this is vague statement.)

The maximum of the x^n/n! tends to occur near x = n. As x increases beyond n, each increment of n decreases our running value.
I propose that we find a formal expression for the maximum, and construct a series where that is the first term
in the series.  In order to make this symmetric about this value, we will have to manipulate the tail of the series,
since the series starts at n = 0, which is in fact assymmetric.  Possibly through some manipulation we can find
a manipulation which is symmetric about the max point.
