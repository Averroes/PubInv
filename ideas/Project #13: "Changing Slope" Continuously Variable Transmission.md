I need to regenerate my drawings for this, which were on paper.

The basic idea is to have convert rotation into oscillation with a crank slider.  The slider then drives a ring
which is perpendicular to the motion of oscillation.  The rate at which this ring is driven is dependent on slope of
the ring at the point of slider. This slope, however, can be varied in any number of ways:

* via solenoids driving rods
* By a toroidal ring that has greater or less compression in this space
* By a track of flexible steel bent into this region at the desired slope.
