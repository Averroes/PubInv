# Motivation

Historically it has been difficult to produce color printing.  With much text now read on computer screens, we should
use color in our orthographies.

# Basic Idea

Convert the Roman Alphabet to little blocks of color.  In particular, two little squares, one on top of each other,
seems like a good plan.

# History

I actually did this and tested it when I was 23 (which was 27 years ago.)  I was developing facility in reading it.
I never completed the task of testing my reading ablity.  At that time, it was rather difficult to do the color
production.

Today it should be possible to test this by either hacking a text editor, such as Emacs, or by making a browser extention.

# Difficulty



# Success Criteria

Can a human being read this more easily than the Roman alphabet?
