NOTE:  This is a pretty huge idea!  The paucity of information here may not make that obvious.

The basic idea is to get to a true three-dimensional volumetric change in a working fluid, rather than the typical one-dimensional or linear change.  This has a huge number of advantages in theory: greater compression ratio, more compactness, slower linear motion, etc.

The basic idea is to use a Tethadron (or cube or something else, it doesn’t matter!) and have each vertex or corner point represent be an “end cap”.  The end caps fit together into the smallest-volume configuration.  In Tets this has a vertex angle of 120 degrees, in cubes 90.

The problem become as this expands, how do you keep it air tight? How do you fill the void space created?

The basic insight is to use a mass of rods that fit together,  The end cap is backed by the rod faces.  As the end-caps spread, new rods are exposed.  As the end-caps spread, new room is created, and a new rod must be inserted from relatively far away in order to reach fill the space and keep things airtight.

Upon contraction, each motion inward which seals a new intersection of rods allows the outer ones to be contracted, thus making room for further contraction.

Such a system could provide a compression ration of 1000:1 with a 10:1 linear change.

Note: I now believe this is pretty easy to understand if you just imagine a cube with a bunch of square prisms forming each side.  Moving each prism in or out allows us to adjust the volume in a way that remains both airtight and may actually strenghen itself over time.  It is assumetric in that the last ones may be harder to push in --- perhaps they should be smaller.

Flash: new idea

Imagine a V-Shaped cup.  We are driving an inverted V into it.  The compression chamber is thus always square.  However, with a simple linear motion, we are decreasing 2 dimensions at the same time.  We use the same “rods behind the end-cap” idea to make space: As the thing squeezes, the end-cap covers a rod on each side, which is then removed to make room for further squeezing.  This means that we can use simple linear motion to produce a Squaring of the pressure.  In 3-D with “suite-case corners” thise becomes a cubing.


This is clearly a publishable idea if it is not known.

Note: It is entirely possible that this could also be done in a “curved” or vase-shaped chamber, which might allow one to adjust for the “squaring” of the force on the linear work.

Note: This whole scheme benefits from the inexepensive nature of electronic controls.
