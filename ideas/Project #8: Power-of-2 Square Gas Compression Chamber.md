NOTE:  This is a pretty huge idea!  The paucity of information here may not make that obvious.

The basic idea is to get to a true three-dimensional volumetric change in a working fluid, rather than the typical one-dimensional or linear change.  This has a huge number of advantages in theory: greater compression ratio, more compactness, slower linear motion, etc.

The basic idea is to use a Tethadron (or cube or something else, it doesn’t matter!) and have each vertex or corner point represent be an “end cap”.  The end caps fit together into the smallest-volume configuration.  In Tets this has a vertex angle of 120 degrees, in cubes 90.

The problem become as this expands, how do you keep it air tight? How do you fill the void space created?

The basic insight is to use a mass of rods that fit together,  The end cap is backed by the rod faces.  As the end-caps spread, new rods are exposed.  As the end-caps spread, new room is created, and a new rod must be inserted from relatively far away in order to reach fill the space and keep things airtight.

Upon contraction, each motion inward which seals a new intersection of rods allows the outer ones to be contracted, thus making room for further contraction.

Such a system could provide a compression ration of 1000:1 with a 10:1 linear change.

Note: I now believe this is pretty easy to understand if you just imagine a cube with a bunch of square prisms forming each side.  Moving each prism in or out allows us to adjust the volume in a way that remains both airtight and may actually strenghen itself over time.  It is assumetric in that the last ones may be harder to push in --- perhaps they should be smaller.

Flash: new idea

Imagine a V-Shaped cup.  We are driving an inverted V into it.  The compression chamber is thus always square.  However, with a simple linear motion, we are decreasing 2 dimensions at the same time.  We use the same “rods behind the end-cap” idea to make space: As the thing squeezes, the end-cap covers a rod on each side, which is then removed to make room for further squeezing.  This means that we can use simple linear motion to produce a Squaring of the pressure.  In 3-D with “suite-case corners” thise becomes a cubing.



If this idea is new, it is surely patentable.  This is clearly a publishable idea if it is not known.

Note: It is entirely possible that this could also be done in a “curved” or vase-shaped chamber, which might allow one to adjust for the “squaring” of the force on the linear work.

Note: This whole scheme benefits from the inexepensive nature of electronic controls.



Note: Given the nature of what we are trying to achieve here, hydraulics may be be the best way to solve this problem, because it would tend to keep the pressure on both sides of the  system equal.  One can imagine a separate hydraulic drum forcing oil into the above large chamber, which drives very high pressure into the small chamber.  Or possibly this pressure makes this whole idea unnecessary.  One might be able to build a gas pressure chamber driven solely by volumetric change from hydraulics.

One can imagine a series of experiments:
Build a simple fire piston
Build a fire piston and load it with wet materials
Build a fire piston that has a “lock” so that the materials can be held at pressure more than instantaneously
Use a compressor or a boiler to simply produce steam at the correct temperature and pressure, load a chamber with the steam, and see what happens.


Note, as an experiment, we might be able to simply use a hydraulic cylinder.  It represents the sealing part already.

Note also that if you apply high pressure without heat you do not get the chemical processes that you want, although most organisms will be killed by very high pressure.

Note: A Waste AutoClave is a very significant similar system:

The question becomes how small a one can be made.  Seems like a daunting process.
