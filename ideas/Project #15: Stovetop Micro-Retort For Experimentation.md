Create a very small retort (reburner) not unlike the classic stovetop expresso makers.  The purpose would be to
perform small-scale experiments in sanitation, waste management, biochar production, and even energy production.

In particular, it would be nice to have such a system instrumented with an Arduino/Raspberry PI type system in order
to have careful control.

In particular we could answer questions such as:
* When does a given payload "go exotermal"?
* What is the energy balance of needed input to output for a given type of payload?
* Can we control emission carefully, perhaps with scrubbers (water and iron sponge)?
* If we were to build heat exchanger, could we run a multiple-batch system that used very small payloads but still 
had reasonable throughputs?

I think this would be particularly valuable for study the sanitation of human feces without water by conversion to biochar.

This project has the advantages of being small-scale and would be fun becasue of its use of a microcontroller.
