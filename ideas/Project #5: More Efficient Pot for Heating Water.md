# More efficient pot

Deisgn a pot, possibly using spirals, to create a more efficient way to heat water on a stove.  
For example, insulate the pot, and duct the air through the middle of the pot.  
Additioanlly, one can even imagine a very intelligent pot that opens and closes vents based on the 
temperature of the air in the pots.

## Success Criteria

Basically we want to build a pot that you can place on a stove and heat water faster (or with less heat and fuel)
than a standard pot. This makes a very clear success criteria.
