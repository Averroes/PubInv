# Motivation

Internal Combustion engines normally use crank shaft which ensure a simple periodic and nearly sinusoidal motion of
the pistons.

However, if we could free ourselves of the circular crank shaft we could perform make a number of improvements.

* We could use a more efficient curve to extract more power during the power cycle.
* We could accelerate the exhaust and intake stroke (or otherwise change the time of the four cycles.)
* We could allow the intake and compression stroke to be different length than the power and exhaust stroke.

# Basic idea: use a Cam-Follower for the Con-Rod

The basic idea is that the connecting rod could be fixed directly to the piston (no bearing required) and driven by
a cam-and-follower system.
