# Ferrofluid based actuator

I believe that we could make an interesting soft actuator by taking a bladder and filling it with ferrofluid, and then placing
electromagnets inside it.

Although it is possible that that by attaching magnets so that the axis was perpendicular to the surface, we could do
interesting things, a simpler approach would just be to fill the actuator with a "cytoskeleton" consisting of, 
for example, hexagonal cards.  Each card would have an electromagnet at each of six symmetric points.

We have already tested that when you put two coils into a ferrofluid and apply voltage, the fluid between them becomes
magnetized and acts as a (weak) magnet, drawing the two oppositely energized coils together. This effect may be 
increased with a solid iron core, instead of an empty coil, but empty coils work.

So the result could be a "tentacle-like" actuator that would be somewhat soft and squishy but somewhat capable of bending,
twisting, lengthening and shortening.

This would be a relatively easy project to undertake.  It would require a microcontroller, probably with some system
that supports multiple motor controller to apply a reasonable amount of current to the coils.

The [Coil Choice](http://pubinv.github.io/CoilChoice/) program would be very helpful for designing the coils.
A simple polyethylene bag could be used as a starting point.  Some plastic sheets with holes cut in them could be used
as the cards.  One could glue sewing machine bobbins on to the card. Alternatively, one could three-d print a system
with 6 bobbins already in place.
