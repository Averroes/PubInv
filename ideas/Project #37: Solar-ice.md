# Solar-Ice

(from Art Malm) 

## The Concept

While on a mision in Puerto Rico, Art Malm and I saw a lot of needs, but one that Art is familiar with is the need for cooling.
Here presents the following idea:

Build a solar-powered ice machine. He imagines a machine that makes 100 pounds of ice a day.

From Rob:

At a basic level, this may already exist. If not we, can certainly save money by not using an inverter, and making a 12V system.
Basically we only need a smart solar charger, a panel, and the ice making apparatus.  If intelligent monitorying could be used to
controller the compressor in such a way that a battery is not needed (or may be made small), the whole system would be 
far more efficient.
