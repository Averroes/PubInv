# Very Simple Heat Engine using bi-stable magnetic device

## Motivation

As mentioned elsewhere, I'm interested in powering an Arduino by extracting heat from a smokestack or chimney.
In general the field known as "microgeneration" is in interesting.

I was trying to create the very, very simplest heat engine that I could to provide about 1 Watt of power (about what
an Arduino draws, I think.) There are of course lots of heat engine, some of which are made on a tiny scale.
There seems to be an entire nice sub-industry building little steam engines and Stirling engines mostly for educational
purposes.  However, Stirling engines have a big flywheel, and seem to require something to start them off. I wanted
an engine that could lay dormant when no heat was in the pipe and then start itself up.  I'm afraid that is dependent
on having good air seals, but I have come up with an idea for a free-pistion egine based on the use of permanent 
magnets to create "bistable mechanical device". The permanent magnets are arranged so as to allow a build up of pressure,
and then to ensure that when the trigger energy is reached, there is enough power to switch the next part of the cycle.
This particular design uses two heat chambers, one of which is closed and one of which is open at all times, and the 
bistable piston guarantees that we are always in sone state or the other and never "stuck".
