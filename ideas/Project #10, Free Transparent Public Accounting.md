Provide free, transparent accounting services

The idea here would be to make an API based way to do basic accounting (and allow backups) and auditing and to let anybody use this.

Iâ€™m not sure how this relates to the blocckhain idea, but I think it is similar --- particularly around identity management.

Allow anyone to reuse the code that will store accounts, and allow anyone to duplicate the books.

This could be extremely powerful and extremely simple.  If we can make it secure in some way, it could be done in a single sprint.
