Create an electric lawn mower that derives its power from being pushed along the ground. Have the generator go into a battery or a super capacitor.  Have the battery turn a rotary power rotary motor at a speed determined by the handle control.

Sell this as a practical, carbon-footprint free, exercise-producing machine.

Use an arduino and a sensor to automatically slow motor if there is not grass to chop --- should be able to detect with visual occlusion of a light.

Make it the first mower with a built in jack (like the Mach 5) for raising it so that you can do maintenance and cleaning of the blade and underside.  Make it the first mower that tends to actually have a sharp blade.

Or perhaps the handle turns into a jack stand for cleaning!

Have it report back how many calories it expended and how much cutting it performed.

Idea:  How about we use much shorter system and use laser power to cut the grass?  Probably highly illegal.

Idea: Instaed of one big blade, use three blades.

Further ideas:

Make the handle such that it is servicable.  Make it baggable with a rake. Use very large back wheels for each of handling.  Detect when extra power is needed.  Note in particular we want the handle to work in such a way that it makes it easy to prop it up exposed for servicing and cleaning of the deck.

TODO:  Talk to Rob Reesor about that guy interested in building a better lawn mower.

Stories:
* Can we charge a battery with a reversible generator?
* Can we chage a battery with an unreliable generator? [Talk to Dave Vaughan]
* Can we build a proper control panel?
* Can we build a proper chassis?
* Can we generate enough power?
* Can we build a blade window?
* Can we make the chassis easy to service?
* Can we build a small model?
* Can we chop up sticks?
* Can we detect stones?
* Can we automatically increase speed when hitting thcker grass?
* Can we build a good raking/bagging system?
* Can we make it beautiful?

# Extention of this idea:

Build a better control system for hacking existing lawn mower:

Dave has a nice battery powered mower which is much nicer than my corded mower (or seemed to be.)  However, it has purely binary motor control.  So an interesting starting project would be to start with one of these mowers (which is better than my own mower) and hack it to have some of these principles.

Professional mower for $399 dollars:  80v.
