# Oracular graph paper

There are different models of computation.  One of these is Compass and Straightedge construction.  If we think if this as a 
model of computation (I don't know to what extent that has been done), we can ask the normal questions
of computation complexity theory. Certainly the class "Constructable" exists within this space.

However, perhaps we can enrich the space by imagining "oracular" graph paper. Imagine that the paper upon which 
we draw with a compass and straightedge can perform a single operation which we do not know how to implement today.
It is thus an analog computer with an "oracle".  The "oracle" in this case will tell you the order of 
two points on a ray in one operation.

This allows you to solve problems which cannot be solved using a standard Church-Turing computer, at least in 
the same time.  For example, because square roots are constructable, you can add one million roots together and 
compare them to a number in O(n) operations.  Yet this cannot be done in that time with an arbitrary number 
with a Church-Turing computer --- or at least, you certainly have have to stand on your head to do it.
