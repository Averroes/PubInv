Let’s use 3-D printing to construct molds that we can use to force trees into a particular shape.  
We could then “grow” a chair -- possibly a living chair, or possibly a wood-skeleton chair.

This is more of an art project than design project!

What is a fast growing woody herb that we could do with this?  Or some shrub---box perhaps? Bamboo obviously,
although it is highly jointed.

Would not a grown, wooden Caryatid be a thing of great beauty?

I imagine this as a new form of sculpture requiring tremendous patience.

Imagine walking through a park where the trees had been sculpted to be playing children!

This would be a fun project because it would involve art, 3D printing, botany, and perhaps the development of new 
techniques for working with living plants.
