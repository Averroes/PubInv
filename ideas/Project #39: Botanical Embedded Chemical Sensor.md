# Botanical Sensors

This idea is completely unresearched; it may be old-hat for all I know.

I recently read "The Revolutionary Genius of Plants" by Stefano Mancuso. It argues that plants have sophisticated behavior,
even in terms of tropism (that is, movement and growth). However, it is possible that plant in fact respond move quickly to 
environmental changes chemically. However, these changes are largely invisible to us.

I think it would be really power to be able to embed a sensor in a plant that could measure chemicals, especially sugar levels,
but possibly phytohormones as well.

The ability to quickly sense chemical changes inside a plant would open up a wide variety of experiments in botany.

This is something that a hobbyist-level microelectronics person can probably do. There is now off-the-shelf sensor technology
that should do this, though I have no doubt that once begun we will say "If only we had an XXX sensor...."
