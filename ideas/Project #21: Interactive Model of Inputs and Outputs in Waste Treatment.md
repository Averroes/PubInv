# Motivation

Many of the projects mentioned here at PIFAH focus on sanitation and waste treatment. Following permaculture
principles, many of these projects attempt to get diverse outputs from the sanitation process to 
decrease waste and increase profit where possible.

Different models of waste treatment require different inputs and produce different outputs.  For example,
composting toilets produce compost but do not produce biogas or biochar. Some systems produce sequestable 
carbon in the form of biochar. Some may even recover water from the waste at various levels of quality.

# Idea

I have previously prodeced a client-side deployable D3 project for creating an [interactive model](http://18f.github.io/d3-technical-debt/index.html)
of technical debt.

I believe we could build such an interactive model that allows one to examine the expected outputs as 
a function of inputs for a particular waste treatment model.  We could attempt to use this as a basis 
for comparing different waste treatement approaches.  Additionally, the code might be valuably forkable
for other projects.

In particular, it could help us answer some basic questions:
* Is there enough energy in human feces, if perfectly acquired, to exceed the energy cost of its processing under
a given treatment approach?
* How much biogas, syngas, or biochar can we expect to obtain from a system?
