# How to Contribute

Although there is no limit to the ways to contribute, some potential contributors might prefer a list of specific
"stories" or other tasks that would be particularly valuable.  This file is an evolving document defining such
stories.  In general we will put things here that are not being actively worked on in order to avoid duplication of effort.

In no particular order:
* I would really like someone to do an energy bance analysis of the production of biochar from wood (and also human feces.)
For example, burning dry wood produces energy.  How does this compare to the energy required to try the wood?  If we
had a perfect "syngas" of "woodgas" production system, how much energy exits in the form of woodgas, as compared to the
pure carbon which is reatined as biochar?
* Does anyone understhand the energy balance of drying in a vacuum?  That is, if I place very moist material, let's say 
an apple, in vacuum, I believe the water inside it boil (or vaporize), and if the pump continues to operate it the vapor
will be removed.  At least this is true if we raise the temperature slightly, say to 40C or 100F. How does this compare
energetically to drying by more rapid heating?  I have researched this for about 45 mintues and have never found a good
explanation of the energy involved.  I believe the cost of the vaporization must still be "paid" one way or another, either 
in the pump or in heat, but it is possible that a process carried out at low temperature may be more efficient.  After all,
we don't really want hot steam as a byproduct, we just want to dry the material at room temperature, all else being equal.
* Does anyone know anything about the efficiency of RF heating?  That is, if we heat a flat material between two electrodes, can we expect this to compare with microwave (magnetron) or joule heating?
