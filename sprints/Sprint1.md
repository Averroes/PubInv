# Theme: Get control of my electronics

## Goals

* Get the HVPS to work - achieved!
* Be able to properly drive a fan
* Get the gas sensosrs to work
* Build the piston assembly of the simple heat engine
* Be able to charge a capacitor for the free piston

# Stories

* Build a simple test circuit for my Fairchild F3055G transistor and make sure I can see a gain in it. - done
* Desolder existing transistor in HVPS - done
* Install other transistor. - done
* Build repo for Homeoduino project.
* Test ability to read Temperature with the little transistor package thing.
* Test ability to read Temperature with thermocouple wire.
* Build test incubator with Joule Heater and Thermometer to test PID and other homeostatis stuff.
* Watch youtube vidoes on Arduino SetPoint stuff.
* 

# Epic

Y'all forgive me mixing some tasks here in with my "stories".

The big "epic" for this week is to prepare for the Austin Mini Maker Faire presentation by the Instrumentation Group of the Engineers Without Borders group on May 16th.  As such:

* Get a gas-sensor-fan-at-12volt-battery supply demonstrable.
* Get a baby-incubator at constant temperature demonstrable.
* Build a "test baby" that is independent that we can put inside the incubator.
* Try to make this all reusable via the "homeoduino" project.

Our basic goal here is to actually advance the EWB projects by building working prototypes as a point along the engineering progression curve.
