# Sprint 0 (Monday, April 20, 2015)

This is my birthday week. I don't feel prepared to begin a sprint, but it is better to begin now without preparation
than to delay another week.

I think in a perfect world I would choose one project and work on that exclusively, with formal stories.

For this sprint, however, I am going to be a bit looser.

I am generally going to work on the complex of projects that involve Pyrolysis, and I am going to focus on setting 
up my laboratory and improving my Arduino skills.  I am also doing some Arduino work with Engineers Without Borders,
and want to continue supporting that.

## Stories:
* Sketch design of Lab -- 3 hours - done, in fact electronic lab is set up
* Order very tall shelving -- 2 hours - done
* Build an Arduino breadboard example of the fan control system for EWB -- 2 hours - done, took to the meeting
* Work out initial mathematics of energy balance of biochar production -- 8 hours
* Experiment with reading analog input with Arduino -- 2 hours -- done
* Attempt to do dielectric heating of a leaf (possibly with David) -- 8 hours -- Need to build a low-current high voltage power supply to do this, it will take longer than 8 hours (got a great reference: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-02x-physics-ii-electricity-magnetism-with-an-experimental-focus-spring-2005/labs/802x.pdf)
* Fill out Texas Glassware License -- 3 hours

(Note: The state of Texas in an attempt to curb Meth production requires you to have a license to own laboratory glassare, even a beaker.  This is an onerous regulation for a hobbyist who doesn't know what he wants, but I intend
to attempt to comply as best I can. The glassware that I need is in support of water quality analysis, pyrolysis, thermal depolymerization, and distillation.)

## Stories as of Wednesday

* Test methane sensor that I got in the mail for EWB with Arduino  - failed
* Test bench power supply - done
* Order parts for safe, low-current HVPS.

## Stories for Thursday

* Build a transistor based oscillator as an exercize.
* Read and study as much of Horowitz and Hill as possible.
* Measured time-constant of an RC circut effectively - done
* Attempt to measure voltage induced by moving magnet - done, with some trouble.


## Final stories of Sprint
* Work with Methane sensor
* Attempt to build High-voltage power supply
