# Sprint 0 (Monday, April 20, 2015)

This is my birthday week. I don't feel prepared to begin a sprint, but it is better to begin now without preparation
than to delay another week.

I think in a perfect world I would choose one project and work on that exclusively, with formal stories.

For this sprint, however, I am going to be a bit looser.

I am generally going to work on the complex of projects that involve Pyrolysis, and I am going to focus on setting 
up my laboratory and improving my Arduino skills.  I am also doing some Arduino work with Engineers Without Borders,
and want to continue supporting that.

## Stories:
* Sketch design of Lab -- 3 hours
* Order very tall shelving -- 2 hours
* Build an Arduino breadboard example of the fan control system for EWB -- 2 hours
* Work out initial mathematics of energy balance of biochar production -- 8 hours
* Experiment with reading analog input with Arduino -- 2 hours
* Attempt to do dielectric heating of a leaf (possibly with David) -- 8 hours
* Fill out Texas Glassware License -- 3 hours

(Note: The state of Texas in an attempt to curb Meth production requires you to have a license to own laboratory glassare, even a beaker.  This is an onerous regulation for a hobbyist who doesn't know what he wants, but I intend
to attempt to comply as best I can. The glassware that I need is in support of water quality analysis, pyrolysis, thermal depolymerization, and distillation.)
