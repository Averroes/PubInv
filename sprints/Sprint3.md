# Theme: Get Ready for Mini Maker Faire, and go onto Pyrolysis

Note: Much of this sprints work will be recorded in the Engineers Without Borders' repo: https://github.com/PIFAH/EWB

## Goals

* Solder up board for MOSFET control
* As experiment, order a PCB of this very simple board.
* Be completely read for Austin Mini Maker Faire

# Stories

* Order a new MQ4 sensor and get a new Pololu board for it.
* Solder up MOSFET board for fan control
* Potentially order PCB board as an experiment.
* Figure out a better way to make presentations
* Publish amp-hour understanding of preemie statistics.
* Figure out a good way to publish everything that we do.
* Write "How to control a Ray Gun with an Arduino".

* Go on to working on basic biochar concepts.
