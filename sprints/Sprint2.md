# Theme: Get Ready for Mini Maker Faire

## Goals

* Be ready for an excellent presentation at Austin Mini Maker Faire May 16th and May 17th
* Produce packaged, testable versions of our circuits.

# Stories

* Test MQ2 and MQ6 sensors -- done!  

(These work very nicely on the oscilloscope.  I assume we can build a nice Arduino circuit, I haven't done that yet.)

* Test MQ4 sensor (this is a little harder because methane is harder to come by---but the sensor is PARTIALLY sensitive
to other flammable gases and alcohol.

* Build nice control system for the test Incubator
* Test PID control system
* Work out energy balance of biochar production
