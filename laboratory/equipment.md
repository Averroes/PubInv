I have ordered an arduino and a high temperature sensor.

I've got lists of other things that will definitely be needed, that will end up costing about $2K.  However, I don't
want to purchase most of these things until I have room set up in my lab.


Sensor ordered from Adafruit
760471-0160979325

$33.98 (includes amplifier for high-temperature probe)
