Is it possible to use salt or a semi-permeable membrane to dry human fecal matter?  (By dry, I mean reduce the water content.)
It is possible that even partial drying might reduce the energy input needed to convert to biochar.

Could we use an adsorption dessicant for this?  I doubt the use of an dessicant can be an energy saver---but it might allow us to get to the point of effective pyrolysis faster, at which point we might have enough heart to treat the dessicant back into a dry state.  In a sense the dessicant then becomes an energy buffer for the system.
