Many, many things that you want to do an an Arduino draw more power than the Arduino can provide.  For example,
driving almost any heater, almost any motor, and even heater-base gas sensors in the MQ-series available from Sparkfun
and Pololu.

Perhpas this is obvious to others, but what is the best way to drive these from various power sources?

The OBVIOUS thing to do is to use a 9V battery to power the Arduino, and a different, probably bigger battery, if you
are using battery power.

But that means you have to have two batteries, which sort of sucks.

What is the best way to drive such a system from:

* A lantern battery,
* A mid-size 12V battery,
* A car battery, 

and so forth.  This is not really "research" but it would make a great article for Arduino lovers, I think.
