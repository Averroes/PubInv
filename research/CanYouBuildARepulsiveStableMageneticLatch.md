# Is it possible to build a magnetic bearing which is a latch?

Can you make an arrangement of permanent magnets thats represents a stable latch, but that does not under normal
circumstances create physical contact?

It is okay if you physically constrain movement to one dimension.

For example you can imagine two parts sliding past each other, and you want them to "latch", until a certain large
amount of force is required to break the thing.

This should allow a friction-free magnetic bearing combined with multipolar opeartion.

BTW, I am doing this for the "Linear Actuator" concept that I am working on.
