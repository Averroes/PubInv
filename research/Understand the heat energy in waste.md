For both wood and fecal matter, we would like to answer some basic questions about the energy balance in the material:
* How much enrgy does it take to dry it?
* How much energy does it produce in the form of syngas through pyrolysis?
* How much energy is available in the form of combustible biochar?

Presumably this is different for a wide range of materials.

According to this:

"The energy content of dry stool is about 2.3 x 10**7 J/kg [5]"

(That's 2.3 Megajoules/kg). Same article states a stool is 70% water.

which sites:

[5] J. L. Murphy et al., "Variability of Fecal Energy Content Measured in Healthy Women," Am. J. of Clinical Nutrition. 58, 137 (1993).

Note that heat of combustion and Lower Heating Value for many fuels are given here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_of_combustion

And 2.3 Megajoules/kg is much lower than wood, for example.

Note: 1 megajoule = 239 005.736 calories, so a 1kg dry stool = 549713.1928 calories.  If we multiply by .3 to represent a dry stool, we get: 164913.9 calories.

To turn the water in the original stool to steam would seem to take:

1000 grams * [((100 - 37 = 63 degree) calories/gram) + 540 calories/gram] = 603 000 calories.

This is similar to answers given here: http://www.nzifst.org.nz/unitoperations/drying1.htm

Which makes it seem that human feces does not have energy energy to convert itself to steam starting from a moist state.  It would seem that it is hopeless to build an self-propelling toilet that attempts to dry completely by quick heating.  We must either add fuel or we must dry via some other mechanism.
