For both wood and fecal matter, we would like to answer some basic questions about the energy balance in the material:
* How much enrgy does it take to dry it?
* How much energy does it produce in the form of syngas through pyrolysis?
* How much energy is available in the form of combustible biochar?

Presumably this is different for a wide range of materials.

According to this:

"The energy content of dry stool is about 2.3 x 10**7 J/kg [5]"

(That's 2.3 Megajoules/kg).

Note that heat of combustion and Lower Heating Value for many fuels are given here:

And 2.3 Megajoules/kg is much lower than wood, for example.
