For both wood and fecal matter, we would like to answer some basic questions about the energy balance in the material:
* How much enrgy does it take to dry it?
* How much energy does it produce in the form of syngas through pyrolysis?
* How much energy is available in the form of combustible biochar?

Presumably this is different for a wide range of materials.
